                        not a valid reason for selecting a particular company. 
                        Purchasing can only accept a <span class="t2">true</span> 
                        Sole Source as justification to waive the bid requirements 
                        for purchases over $50,000.</li>

                        The first step is for the Principle Investigator (PI) 
                        and/or Program Administrator to determine what is needed 
                        to accomplish the research/project. (We in Purchasing 
                        rely on the PI's to be the &quot;resident authority&quot; 
                        on the item they are wanting). Once the item has been 
                        identified as only available from one source, then the 
                        vendor should provide a written quotation. Please note 
                        that written quotes are normally only good for 30 days 
                        and Purchasing will return the requisition and attachments 
                        if the time period has expired. Once the quote is received, 
                        the Sole Source Certification Form located at <a href="http://www.purchasing.ufl.edu/Sole_source_.doc " target="_blank">http://www.purchasing.ufl.edu/Sole_source_.doc </a> should be typed and all items should be answered thoroughly, in layman's terms. Do not leave any question blank. The PI should 
                        then sign the Sole Source Certification under the &quot;Department 
                        Approval, Principle Investigator's Signature&quot; heading. 
                        The &quot;Purchasing Approval, Purchasing Agent's Signature 
                        and Authorized Signature&quot;lines will be signed by 
                        Purchasing. </li>
